<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I’m Rishi, an aspiring web developer who has just started exploring the world of websites and how the internet works. I’m currently learning HTML and slowly building my foundation one step at a time. I may not know much yet, but I’m fully committed to learning and growing every day.</p>

</p>I believe in staying consistent, even if I’m slow. I don’t have all the answers yet, but I’m not afraid to ask questions, make mistakes, and start again when needed. Right now, my main goal is to finish my first complete course in web development and build real projects from scratch.</p>

<p>Apart from coding, I’m curious about creative fields like video editing and storytelling, which I hope to learn in the future. I’m using this time to discover my interests, build good habits, and work toward a future I can be proud of.</p>
